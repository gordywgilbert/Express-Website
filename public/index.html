            <li>Maintained a CMS used to connect employers, health insurance brokers, and their carriers throughout 23
                states. The framework was created with Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS3 and MySQL.
            </li>
            <li>Created customizable downloadable reports for our clients as requested. Reports included: missing
                enrollment
                information, enrollment details, and health history reports, among others. The information was then able
                to
                be exported in PDF, HTML, and Excel documents.
            </li>

            <li>Developed a two-way electronic data interchange process for importing and exporting batches of health

                en
                masse. Because billing was determined by the number of employees enrolled, this resulted in a
                significant
                increase in monthly revenue for my employer.
            </li>
            <li>Served as the primary point of contact for 50+ clients across all 23 states clients resided in. Contacts
