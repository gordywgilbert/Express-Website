        <p><span class="bold">Junior Developer, Benefit Resource Inc. (2004 - 2014)</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintained a CMS used to connect employers, health insurance brokers, and their carriers throughout 23
                states. The framework was created with Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS3 and MySQL.
            </li>
            <li>Created customizable downloadable reports for our clients as requested. Reports included: missing
                enrollment
                information, enrollment details, and health history reports, among others. The information was then able
                to be exported in PDF, HTML, and Excel documents.
            </li>
            <li>Performed duties of the Chief Technology Officer during January 2012, in addition to regular developer

            <li>Developed a two-way electronic data interchange process for importing and exporting batches of health
                information for employers. This was done using CSV files This feature allowed employees to be imported
                on a massive scale. Because billing was determined by the number of employees in our database, this
                resulted in a significant increase in monthly revenue for my employer.
            </li>
            <li>Served as the primary point of contact for 50+ clients across all 23 states clients resided in. Contacts

                maintaining our databases to accommodate both state and carrier specific health questions as required by
                our clients.
            </li>
            <li>Refined and documented the enrollment process for employers and brokers in a 30+ page word document.
