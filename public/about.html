            <p><span class="bold">Junior Developer, Benefit Resource Inc. (2004 - 2014)</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maintained a CMS used to connect employers, health insurance brokers, and their carriers throughout
                    23 states. The framework was created with Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS3 and MySQL.
                </li>
                <li>Created customizable downloadable reports for our clients as requested. Reports included: missing
                    enrollment information, enrollment details, and health history reports, among others. The
                    information was then able to be exported in PDF, HTML, and Excel documents.
                </li>
                <li>Performed duties of the Chief Technology Officer during January 2012, in addition to regular
                    developer responsibilities. Worked as the only developer at my employer during this time.

                <li>Responsible for administering a large MySQL server database and incorporating new features while

                <li>Developed a two-way electronic data interchange process for importing and exporting batches of
                    health information for employers. This was done using CSV files This feature allowed employees to be
                    imported on a massive scale. Because billing was determined by the number of employees in our
                    database, this resulted in a significant increase in monthly revenue for my employer.
                </li>
                <li>Served as the primary point of contact for 50+ clients across all 23 states clients resided in.

                    gathered during their enrollment process. This included maintaining 50+ forms across 23 states while
                    updating and administering our databases to accommodate both state and carrier specific health
                    questions as required by our clients.
                </li>
                <li>Refined and documented the enrollment process for employers and brokers in a 30+ page word document.
